        <description>City guide Android app that demonstrates Kaa’s endpoint profiling, grouping, and configuration management capabilities</description>
        <details>
            <![CDATA[
This Android app illustrates how the Kaa Configuration subsystem can be used to deliver custom-tailored contents to endpoints depending on their profile.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download the .apk to your Android device by clicking the "Binary" button on the left. Make sure that the device permits installing apps from "Unknown sources". Open the downloaded apk and follow the on-screen instructions.

<h2>Playing around</h2>
Make sure that the Kaa Sandbox is up and running. Opening the "City Guide Demo" app will lead you to nested lists of areas, cities, and places of interest currently visible to the app. You can limit the visibility by choosing a specific area and a city by pressing the "SET LOCATION" button in the upper right corner.<br/><br/>

To understand better how this app works, you should navigate to the Kaa server administrative interface by clicking the "Administrative console" link at the top of the Sandbox window. Log in as a tenant developer (devuser / devuser123), and go to to the "City guide" application, then select "Schemas", "Profile". Choosing the profile schema version 2 in the list will allow inspecting the contents of the profile that the app sends to the Kaa server. It contains two values: the area and the city. The Kaa server uses these values to filter endpoints by their profile contents and make only relevant content visible to the app.<br/><br/>

Now open the "Configuration" schema under "Schemas" and select version 2 to see the structure of the configuration data. There are two arrays in the configuration schema: "availableAreas" and "areas". The former defines a list of areas available under the "SET LOCATION" dialogue that goes into the endpoint profile. The latter defines the content of the main app screen, including the points of interest and their descriptions.<br/><br/>

Finally, it's time to see what the configuration data is composed of. To do so, go to the "Endpoint groups" section. There are three endpoint groups available.<br/><br/>

Group "all" configuration defines a list of available for selection areas and cities ("availableAreas").<br/><br/>

The "North America/Atlanta" and "Europe/Amsterdam" groups apply to the endpoints which have the corresponding area and the city in the profile. (It also applies to the endpoints with unset profile). Observe the corresponding profile filters in the group details window. The configuration associated with these two groups defines the contents displayed for the areas of interest in these locations. Feel free to open the configuration data for schema version 2 and browse the configuration body. You are also welcome to make your changes to the configuration and see how the updates get propagated to your Android device.

Please note that all the features of Administration UI are also supported by REST API.
