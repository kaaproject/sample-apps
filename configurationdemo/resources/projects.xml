This simple app demonstrates capabilities of the Kaa Configuration subsystem on the Java SDK.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download the jar file to your device by clicking the "Binary" button on the left. Make sure that you have Java installed on your device. Run the application using the following command in the console:
<pre>
$ java -jar ConfigurationDemo.jar
</pre>

<h2>Playing around</h2>
Make sure that the Kaa Sandbox is up and running. After starting the "Configuration Java demo" app, you will obtain the latest configuration accessible by the endpoint. This configuration is provided as a list of links to Kaa documentation.<br/><br/>

Now it's time to test things out: navigate to the Kaa server administrative interface by clicking the "Administrative console" link at the top of the Sandbox window. Log in as a tenant developer (devuser / devuser123), and navigate to the "Configuration demo" application, then select "Endpoint groups". From here you can manage endpoint groups and update endpoint configuration. Make sure you have tried updating configuration for endpoint group "All" and received it on your device. Do not forget to activate the updated configuration â€” otherwise the endpoint will not be able to receive it.<br/><br/>

Please note that all the features of Administration UI are also supported by REST API.

<body>
	<p>
	    This sample application uses the <b>Configuration Extension</b> based on the <a href="./Glossary/#sdk-type">Kaa C SDK</a>.
		This extension enables <a href="./Glossary/#kaa-client">Kaa client</a> to update the <a href="./Glossary/#endpoint-ep">endpoint</a> configuration by receiving the data from <a href="./Glossary/#kaa-server">Kaa server</a>.
		The default configuration is statically stored in the Kaa SDK and is used in case no updates from the <a href="./Glossary/#operations-service">Operations service</a> are available.
	</p>
	
	<h1>Launching</h1>
	
	To launch this sample application on the Kaa C SDK:
	
	<ol>
		<li>
			Prepare your C SDK environment. To do this, follow the instructions in <a href="./Programming-guide/Using-Kaa-endpoint-SDKs/C/">Using Kaa endpoint SDKs</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Click the <b>Source</b> button. A project source download window will open. Click <b>Ok</b> and download the .tar.gz file.
		</li>
		<li>
			Unpack the downloaded archive and run the following command from the root directory.
			<p>
				<b>Windows</b>
				<pre>
					build.bat deploy	
				</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Linux, OS X (macOS)</b>
				<pre>
					./build.sh deploy	
				</pre>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			The program will ask you to enter the target platform for your build.
			Press Enter to specify the x86-64 platform (default) or enter the name of one of the <a href="./Programming-guide/Using-Kaa-endpoint-SDKs/Supported-platforms/">supported platforms</a> and press Enter.
			The C SDK and the demo application are now built and the demo application is launched.
		</li>
	</ol>
	
	Once you built the application, you can start it at any time using the following command.
	
	<p>
		<b>Windows</b>
		<pre>
			build.bat run	
		</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Linux, OS X (macOS)</b>
		<pre>
			./build.sh run	
		</pre>
	</p>
	
	<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
	
	<h2>Running the build.sh script returns an error message</h2>
	
	<pre>
		Please, put the generated C/C++ SDK tarball into the libs/kaa folder and re-run the script.
	</pre>
	
	<p>
		This means that no SDK tarball was found in the libs/kaa directory.
	</p>
	
	Try the following:
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			Download and install the <a href="./Glossary/#kaa-sandbox">Kaa Sandbox</a>.
			To do this, follow the instructions in <a href="./Getting-started/">Getting started</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Download the SDK tarball for this sample application and put it in the libs/kaa folder.
			To do this, follow the instructions in <a href="./Programming-guide/Your-first-Kaa-application/#generating-sdk">Generating SDK</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>CMake returns an error message</h2>
	
	<pre>
		CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND: (...)
	</pre>
	
	<p>
		This means that CMake could not find the required libraries because they were not installed correctly.
		To address this issue, check if you completed all the required steps of the <a href="./Programming-guide/Using-Kaa-endpoint-SDKs/C/">C SDK installation instructions</a>.
	</p>
