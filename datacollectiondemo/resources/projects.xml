        <description>Kaa Logging subsystem demo app based on Java SDK</description>
        <details><![CDATA[
This simple app demonstrates capabilities of the Kaa Logging subsystem on the Java SDK.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download the jar file to your device by clicking the "Binary" button on the left. Make sure that you have Java installed on your device. Run the application using the following command in the console:
<pre>
$ java -jar DataCollectionDemo.jar
</pre>

<h2>Playing around</h2>
Make sure that the Kaa Sandbox is up and running. By starting the "Data collection Java demo" app, you will trigger delivery of five log messages from the endpoint to the Kaa cluster. The Kaa cluster will persist those messages in a sandbox MongoDB database using a MongoDB appender. You can explore the collected data by querying the sandbox MongoDB instance as follows:
<pre>
$ mongo kaa
db.logs_$your_application_token$.find()
</pre>

Where $your_application_token$ is the application token you can copy from the main window of the application in the Administration UI.<br/><br/>

You can also create custom log appenders. Navigate to the Kaa server administrative interface by clicking the "Administrative console" link at the top of the Sandbox window. Log in as a tenant developer (devuser / devuser123), and navigate to the "Data collection demo" application, then select "Log appenders". From here you can manage log appenders.<br/><br/>

Please note that all the features of Administration UI are also supported by REST API.
