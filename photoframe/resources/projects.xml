This app demonstrates the capabilities of the Kaa Event subsystem for Android.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download the .apk to your Android device by clicking the "Binary" button on the left. Make sure that the device permits installing apps from "Unknown sources". Open the downloaded apk and follow the on-screen instructions.

<h2>Playing around</h2>
Make sure that the Kaa Sandbox is up and running. You will need to install this application on at least two devices and log in with same user name. Any password will be accepted since the trustful user verifier is used for user verification.<br/><br/>

Each endpoint scans its photo library and sends metadata about the albums to other endpoints using the Kaa Event subsystem. Every endpoint can select one of the photo albums in order to trigger a slideshow on the target endpoint.<br/><br/>

Please note that all the features of Administration UI are also supported by REST API.

<h2>What's next?</h2>

For more background on Kaa Event subsystem please refer to the corresponding programming guide and design reference sections.
