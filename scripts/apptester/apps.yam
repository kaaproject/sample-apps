# This file contains configurations to build sample applications.
# Please, take care on application name. The name is unique for
# each application and for now it is used to download proper Kaa SDK.
# We cannot use application ID (or token) since it can be changed
# during the building of the Kaa Sandbox.
#
# To build and test applications all necessary tools must be installed.
#
# TODO list
# http://jira.kaaproject.org/browse/APP-53 - tests will be added
# http://jira.kaaproject.org/browse/APP-194 - build command will be changed
# http://jira.kaaproject.org/browse/KSF-74 - it will be possible to download
# an application code directly from Sandbox.
#
