This app demonstrates the capabilities of the Kaa Event subsystem for Android.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download the .apk to your Android device by clicking the "Binary" button on the left. Make sure that the device permits installing apps from "Unknown sources". Open the downloaded apk and follow the on-screen instructions.

<h2>Playing around</h2>
Make sure that the Kaa Sandbox is up and running. You will need to install this application on at least two devices. Start the application on one of the devices and choose "Smart House". Any password will be accepted since the trustful user verifier is used for user verification.

Start the application on the second device and choose "Thermostat" or "Sound System". This will automatically generate and display a QR code on the device’s screen. Use the first device application (smart house) to scan this QR code and connect the second device to the same user. Now you can control your thermostat or the sound system from the smart house application.
<br/><br/>

Please note that all the features of Administration UI are also supported by REST API.
