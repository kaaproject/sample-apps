To run the demo application, do the following:

1. Install third-party libraries to build the Kaa C++ SDK.
Follow http://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Third-party+components#Third-partycomponents-Kaaendpoint to see the full
list of third-party dependencies for the Kaa C++ SDK.
2. Download and install the Kaa sandbox (http://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/sandbox).
3. Generate the C++ SDK using the Kaa sandbox. The Avro log schema required for the demo application is located in 
the 'avro' directory. Put the SDK archive into the 'libs/kaa' directory.
