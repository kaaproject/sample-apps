        <description>IoT real-time data processing in Apache Storm using Kaa</description>
        <details><![CDATA[
This application demonstrates real-time data processing in Apache Storm using Kaa platform, and Kaa Java SDK-based client application. <br /> <br />
Storm receives log data from Kaa clients via the Kaa Flume log appender as a Flume event and then prints this data. <br />
To learn more about Storm basics such as a spout, a bolt, etc., please refer to the <a href="https://storm.apache.org/documentation/Tutorial.html">official
Apache Storm tutorial</a>.

<h2>Installation</h2>
1. Download the source code by clicking the "Source" button on the left and unpack the downloaded archive. <br />
2. Go to the KaaStormServer folder and run server side Storm application by executing folowing command (we assume you have JDK 1.8 and Maven 3.0+ installed):
<pre>
$ mvn clean install
</pre>
3. After the following message appears:
<pre>
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
</pre>
Run:
<pre>
$ java -jar target/storm-server-example.jar
</pre>
If no errors occurred, you’ve successfully started the Storm topology. <br />
4. Configure Flume log appender via the
<a href="http://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Administration+UI+guide#AdministrationUIguide-Flumelogappender">Administrative console</a> of your Kaa Sandbox.
As a tenant admin, go to the Storm data analytics demo application >> Log Appenders >> Storm data analytics demo log appender and change host parameter from localhost
to your host address. Click Save button. <br />
5. Go to JStormDataAnalyticsDemo folder of your unpacked archive and execute command:
<pre>
$ mvn clean install
</pre>
6. Launch the Storm data analytics demo application using the following command:
<pre>
$ java -jar target/storm-client-example.jar
</pre>
7. Now look at the Storm server output. You will see the following lines:
<pre>
...
Sample zone ID: 9, panel ID: 7, power: 68.49944021603773
...
Total records received: 1
Total samples received: 100
…
</pre>

<h2>Playing around</h2>
Make sure that the Kaa Sandbox is up and running. After starting the "Storm data analytics demo" application, you will receive statistics values from
the endpoint in your server side application.
