        <description>Kaa user verifiers demo app for Android</description>
        <details>
            <![CDATA[
This simple app demonstrates a user verification flow in Kaa for Android.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download the .apk to your Android device by clicking the "Binary" button on the left. Make sure that the device permits installing apps from "Unknown sources". Open the downloaded apk and follow the on-screen instructions.

<h2>Playing around</h2>
Make sure that the Kaa Sandbox is up and running. After opening the "User verifiers demo" app, you will be able to log in to Facebook, Google or Twitter in order to get verified by the corresponding user verifier. After the verification is complete, you can start sending test messages to other devices through the Kaa Event subsystem.

Now it's time to test things out: install this app on different devices and log in with the same account. Once logged in, enter your message on some device and send it to other devices where you logged into the application. Please note that this demo is not an attempt to implement yet another "chat application". It is rather a PoC of a way to connect and exchange messages between devices that belong to the same user.

Please note that all the features of Administration UI are also supported by REST API.

<h2>What's next?</h2>

For more background on the user verification refer to the corresponding design reference section. It is also possible to implement a custom user verifier using programming guide.
